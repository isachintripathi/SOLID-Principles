# SOLID-Principles
## A set  of principles/rules that needs to be followed while designing/developing any application.
They are :
1. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle): A class should take care of only one responsibility. 
2. OCP (Open/Closed Principle): Extension would be preffered over modification. A class should be closed for modification but open for extension.
3. LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle): parent class object can refer child class objects seamlessly during runtime polymorphism.
4. ISP (Interface Segrigation Principle): A client should not be forced to use an interface if they are not using it. 
5. DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle): High level modules should not depends on low level modules But should depends on abstraction.
